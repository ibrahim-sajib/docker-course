# Docker Course Projects

This repository contains multiple Docker-based project setups for practicing and learning containerized web applications. It includes the following sub-projects:

- `hello-docker`
- `laravel-docker`
- `mern-docker`
- `next-docker`
- `react-docker`
- `vite-project`

## About

These projects are built as part of my learning journey with Docker, container orchestration, and modern development workflows. They showcase working examples of different frameworks running inside Docker containers.

## Credits

Many of these project setups are inspired by and based on tutorials from [JavaScript Mastery].

This is a personal learning repository. Feel free to explore and use these setups as a starting point for your own experiments.
